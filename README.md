## 📁 Files Included

- `student_analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Basic statistical analysis
  - Visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)
  - Findings and observations

- `students.csv` *(optional)* — Sample dataset file, if exported separately
